#### Exercises

**Exercise 1.1: Environment Validation** (2 hours)
```python
# Validate your Python setup
# Create a script that:
# - Generates a sine wave at 1 kHz sampled at 44.1 kHz
# - Plots time domain representation
# - Computes and plots FFT
# - Saves results to file
```

**Exercise 1.2: Complex Signal Basics** (3 hours)
```python
# Implement from scratch (no scipy.signal):
# - Complex exponential signal generation
# - I/Q representation of modulated signals
# - Amplitude and phase extraction
# - Visualization of constellation diagrams
```

**Exercise 1.3: Sampling Theory** (2 hours)
```python
- Demonstrate aliasing with various sampling rates
- Implement and visualize the sampling theorem
- Create anti-aliasing filter example
```

#### Guided Project 1: Signal Analysis Toolkit (5 hours)

```python
Build a Python module that provides:
- Signal generation functions (sine, square, triangle, noise)
- Time-domain analysis (RMS, peak detection, zero crossings)
- Frequency-domain analysis (FFT, PSD, spectrogram)
- Basic filtering (moving average, simple IIR)
- Visualization utilities
```
